            "Digital life is augmenting human capacities and disrupting eons-old human activities. Code-driven systems have spread to more than half of the world’s inhabitants in ambient information and connectivity, offering previously unimagined opportunities and unprecedented threats. As emerging algorithm-driven artificial intelligence (AI) continues to spread, will people be better off than they are today?\n",
            "\n",
            "Some 979 technology pioneers, innovators, developers, business and policy leaders, researchers and activists answered this question in a canvassing of experts conducted in the summer of 2018.\n",
            "\n",
            "The experts predicted networked artificial intelligence will amplify human effectiveness but also threaten human autonomy, agency and capabilities. They spoke of the wide-ranging possibilities; that computers might match or even exceed human intelligence and capabilities on tasks such as complex decision-making, reasoning and learning, sophisticated analytics and pattern recognition, visual acuity, speech recognition and language translation. They said “smart” systems in communities, in vehicles, in buildings and utilities, on farms and in business processes will save time, money and lives and offer opportunities for individuals to enjoy a more-customized future.\n",
            "\n",
            "Many focused their optimistic remarks on health care and the many possible applications of AI in diagnosing and treating patients or helping senior citizens live fuller and healthier lives. They were also enthusiastic about AI’s role in contributing to broad public-health programs built around massive amounts of data that may be captured in the coming years about everything from personal genomes to nutrition. Additionally, a number of these experts predicted that AI would abet long-anticipated changes in formal and informal education systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yet, most experts, regardless of whether they are optimistic or not, expressed concerns about the long-term impact of these new tools on the essential elements of being human. All respondents in this non-scientific canvassing were asked to elaborate on why they felt AI would leave people better off or not. Many shared deep worries, and many also suggested pathways toward solutions. The main themes they sounded about threats and remedies are outlined in the accompanying table.\n",

            "“Please think forward to the year 2030. Analysts expect that people will become even more dependent on networked artificial intelligence (AI) in complex digital systems. Some say we will continue on the historic arc of augmenting our lives with mostly positive results as we widely implement these networked tools. Some say our increasing dependence on these AI and related systems is likely to lead to widespread difficulties.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our question: By 2030, do you think it is most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will enhance human capacities and empower them? That is, most of the time, will most people be better off than they are today? Or is it most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will lessen human autonomy and agency to such an extent that most people will not be better off than the way things are today?”\n",

            "Overall, and despite the downsides they fear, 63% of respondents in this canvassing said they are hopeful that most individuals will be mostly better off in 2030, and 37% said people will not be better off.\n",

            "A number of the thought leaders who participated in this canvassing said humans’ expanding reliance on technological systems will only go well if close attention is paid to how these tools, platforms and networks are engineered, distributed and updated.

            "Sonia Katyal, co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology and a member of the inaugural U.S. Commerce Department Digital Economy Board of Advisors, predicted, “In 2030, the greatest set of questions will involve how perceptions of AI and their application will influence the trajectory of civil rights in the future. Questions about privacy, speech, the right of assembly and technological construction of personhood will all re-emerge in this new AI context, throwing into question our deepest-held beliefs about equality and opportunity for all. Who will benefit and who will be disadvantaged in this new world depends on how broadly we analyze these questions today, for the future.”\n",

For instance, we can virtually eliminate global poverty, massively reduce disease and provide better education to almost everyone on the planet. That said, AI and ML [machine learning] can also be used to increasingly concentrate wealth and power, leaving many people behind, and to create even more horrifying weapons. Neither outcome is inevitable, so the right question is not ‘What will happen?’ but ‘What will we choose to do?’ We need to work aggressively to make sure technology matches our values. This can and must be done at all levels, from government, to business, to academia, and to individual choices.”\n",

            "Bryan Johnson, founder and CEO of Kernel, a leading developer of advanced neural interfaces, and OS Fund, a venture capital firm, said, “I strongly believe the answer depends on whether we can shift our economic systems toward prioritizing radical human improvement and staunching the trend toward human irrelevance in the face of AI.

As a species we are aggressive, competitive and lazy. We are also empathic, community minded and (sometimes) self-sacrificing. We have many other attributes. These will all be amplified. Given historical precedent, one would have to assume it will be our worst qualities that are augmented. My expectation is that in 2030 AI will be in routine use to fight wars and kill people, far more effectively than we can currently kill. As societies we will be less affected by this as we currently are, as we will not be doing the fighting and killing ourselves. Our capacity to modify our behaviour, subject to empathy and an associated ethical framework, will be reduced by the disassociation between our agency and the act of killing. We cannot expect our AI systems to be ethical on our behalf – they won’t be, as they will be designed to kill efficiently, not thoughtfully. My other primary concern is to do with surveillance and control. The advent of China’s Social Credit System (SCS) is an indicator of what it likely to come. We will exist within an SCS as AI constructs hybrid instances of ourselves that may or may not resemble who we are. But our rights and affordances as individuals will be determined by the SCS.

The public is reduced to a collective of consumers awaiting the next technology. Whose notion of ‘progress’ will prevail? We have ample evidence of AI being used to drive profits, regardless of implications for long-held values; to enhance governmental control and even score citizens’ ‘social credit’ without input from citizens themselves. Like technologies before it, AI is agnostic. Its deployment rests in the hands of society. But absent an AI-literate public, the decision of how best to deploy AI will fall to special interests. Will this mean equitable deployment, the amelioration of social injustice and AI in the public service? Because the answer to this question is social rather than technological, I’m pessimistic. The fix? We need to develop an AI-literate public, which means focused attention in the educational sector and in public-facing media. We need to assure diversity in the development of AI technologies. And until the public, its elected representatives and their legal and regulatory regimes can get up to speed with these fast-moving developments we need to exercise caution and oversight in AI’s development.”\n",

than half of the world’s inhabitants in ambient information and connectivity, offering previously unimagined opportunities and unprecedented threats.', 'As emerging algorithm-driven artificial intelligence (AI) continues to spread, will people be better off than they are today?', 'Some 979 technology pioneers, innovators, developers, business and policy leaders, researchers and activists answered this question in a canvassing of experts conducted in the summer of 2018.', 'The experts predicted networked artificial intelligence will amplify human effectiveness but also threaten human autonomy, agency and capabilities.', 'They spoke of the wide-ranging possibilities; that computers might match or even exceed human intelligence and capabilities on tasks such as complex decision-making, reasoning and learning, sophisticated analytics and pattern recognition, visual acuity, speech recognition and language translation.', 'They said “smart” systems in communities, in vehicles, in buildings and utilities, on farms and in business processes will save time, money and lives and offer opportunities for individuals to enjoy a more-customized future.', 'Many focused their optimistic remarks on health care and the many possible applications of AI in diagnosing and treating patients or helping senior citizens live fuller and healthier lives.', 'They were also enthusiastic about AI’s role in contributing to broad public-health programs built around massive amounts of data that may be captured in the coming years about everything from personal genomes to nutrition.', 'Additionally, a number of these experts predicted that AI would abet long-anticipated changes in formal and informal education systems.', 'Yet, most experts, regardless of whether they are optimistic or not, expressed concerns about the long-term impact of these new tools on the essential elements of being human.', 'All respondents in this non-scientific canvassing were asked to elaborate on why they felt AI would leave people better off or not.', 'Many shared deep worries, and many also suggested pathways toward solutions.', 'The main themes they sounded about threats and remedies are outlined in the accompanying table.', '[chart id=”21972″]\\n\\nSpecifically, participants were asked to consider the following:\\n\\n“Please think forward to the year 2030.', 'Analysts expect that people will become even more dependent on networked artificial intelligence (AI) in complex digital systems.', 'Some say we will continue on the historic arc of augmenting our lives with mostly positive results as we widely implement these networked tools.', 'Some say our increasing dependence on these AI and related systems is likely to lead to widespread difficulties.', 'Our question: By 2030, do you think it is most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will enhance human capacities and empower them?', 'That is, most of the time, will most people be better off than they are today?', 'Or is it most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will lessen human autonomy and agency to such an extent that most people will not be better off than the way things are today?”\\n\\nOverall, and despite the downsides they fear, 63% of respondents in this canvassing said they are hopeful that most individuals will be mostly better off in 2030, and 37% said people will not be better off.', 'A number of the thought leaders who participated in this canvassing said humans’ expanding reliance on technological systems will only go well if close attention is paid to how these tools, platforms and networks are engineered, distributed and updated.', 'Some of the powerful, overarching answers included those from:\\n\\nSonia Katyal, co-director

how perceptions of AI and their application will influence the trajectory of civil rights in the future.', 'Questions about privacy, speech, the right of assembly and technological construction of personhood will all re-emerge in this new AI context, throwing into question our deepest-held beliefs about equality and opportunity for all.', 'Who will benefit and who will be disadvantaged in this new world depends on how broadly we analyze these questions today, for the future.”\\n\\nWe need to work aggressively to make sure technology matches our values.', 'Erik Brynjolfsson Erik Brynjolfsson\\n\\nErik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and author of “Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future,” said, “AI and related technologies have already achieved superhuman performance in many areas, and there is little doubt that their capabilities will improve, probably very significantly, by 2030.', '… I think it is more likely than not that we will use this power to make the world a better place.', 'For instance, we can virtually eliminate global poverty, massively reduce disease and provide better education to almost everyone on the planet.', 'That said, AI and ML [machine learning] can also be used to increasingly concentrate wealth and power, leaving many people behind, and to create even more horrifying weapons.', 'Neither outcome is inevitable, so the right question is not ‘What will happen?’ but ‘What will we choose to do?’ We need to work aggressively to make sure technology matches our values.', 'This can and must be done at all levels, from government, to business, to academia, and to individual choices.”\\n\\nBryan Johnson, founder and CEO of Kernel, a leading developer of advanced neural interfaces, and OS Fund, a venture capital firm, said, “I strongly believe the answer depends on whether we can shift our economic systems toward prioritizing radical human improvement and staunching the trend toward human irrelevance in the face of AI.', 'I don’t mean just jobs; I mean true, existential irrelevance, which is the end result of not prioritizing human well-being and cognition.”\\n\\nMarina

of AI objective functions, then AI could catalyze an explosion of happiness.”\\n\\nKostas Alexandridis, author of “Exploring Complex Dynamics in Multi-agent-based Intelligent Systems,” predicted, “Many of our day-to-day decisions will be automated with minimal intervention by the end-user.', 'Autonomy and/or independence will be sacrificed and replaced by convenience.', 'Newer generations of citizens will become more and more dependent on networked AI structures and processes.', 'There are challenges that need to be addressed in terms of critical thinking and heterogeneity.', 'Networked interdependence will, more likely than not, increase our vulnerability to cyberattacks.', 'There is also a real likelihood that there will exist sharper divisions between digital ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots,’ as well as among technologically dependent digital infrastructures.', 'Finally, there is the question of the new ‘commanding heights’ of the digital network infrastructure’s ownership and control.”\\n\\nOscar Gandy, emeritus professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, responded, “We already face an ungranted assumption when we are asked to imagine human-machine ‘collaboration.’ Interaction is a bit different, but still tainted by the grant of a form of identity – maybe even personhood – to machines that we will use to make our way through all sorts of opportunities and challenges.', 'The problems we will face in the future are quite similar to the problems we currently face when we rely upon ‘others’ (including technological systems, devices and networks) to acquire things we value and avoid those other things (that we might, or might not be aware of).”\\n\\nJames Scofield O’Rourke, a professor of management at the University of Notre Dame, said, “Technology has, throughout recorded history, been a largely neutral concept.', 'The question of its value has always been dependent on its application.', 'For what purpose will AI and other technological advances be used?', 'Everything from gunpowder to internal combustion engines to nuclear fission has been applied in both helpful and destructive ways.', 'Assuming we can contain or control AI (and not the other way around), the answer to whether we’ll be better off depends entirely on us (or our progeny).', '‘The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.’”\\n\\nSimon Biggs, a professor of interdisciplinary arts at the University of Edinburgh, said, “AI will function to augment human capabilities.', 'The problem is not with AI but with humans.', 'As a species we are aggressive, competitive and lazy.', 'We are also empathic, community minded and (sometimes) self-sacrificing.', 'We have many other attributes.', 'These will all be amplified.', 'Given historical precedent, one would have to assume it will be our worst qualities that are augmented.', 'My expectation is that in 2030 AI will be in routine use to fight wars and kill people, far more effectively than we can currently kill.', 'As societies we will be less affected by this as we currently are, as we will not be doing the fighting and killing ourselves.', 'Our capacity to modify our behaviour, subject to empathy and an associated ethical framework, will be reduced by the disassociation between our agency and the act of killing.', 'We cannot expect our AI systems to be ethical on our behalf – they won’t be, as they will be designed to kill efficiently, not thoughtfully.', 'My other primary concern is to do with surveillance and control.', 'The advent of China’s Social Credit System (SCS) is an indicator of what it likely to come.', 'We will exist within an SCS as AI constructs hybrid instances of ourselves that may or may not resemble who we are.', 'But our rights and affordances as individuals will be determined by the SCS.', 'This is the Orwellian nightmare realised.”\\n\\nMark Surman, executive director of the Mozilla Foundation, responded, “AI will continue to concentrate power and wealth in the hands of a few big monopolies based on the U.S. and China.', 'Most people – and parts of the world – will be worse off.”\\n\\nWilliam Uricchio, media scholar and professor of comparative media studies at MIT, commented, “AI and its related applications face three problems: development at the speed of Moore’s Law, development in the hands of a technological and economic elite, and development without benefit of an informed or engaged public.', 'The public is reduced to a collective of consumers awaiting the next technology.', 'Whose notion of ‘progress’ will prevail?', 'We have ample evidence of AI being used to drive profits, regardless of implications for long-held values; to enhance governmental control and even score citizens’ ‘social credit’ without input from citizens themselves.', 'Like technologies before it, AI is agnostic.', 'Its deployment rests in the hands of society.', 'But absent an AI-literate public, the decision of how best to deploy AI will fall to special interests.', 'Will this mean equitable deployment, the amelioration of social injustice and AI in the public service?', 'Because the answer to this question is social rather than technological, I’m pessimistic.', 'The fix?', 'We need to develop an AI-literate public, which means focused attention in the educational sector and in public-facing media.', 'We need to assure diversity in the development of AI technologies.', 'And until the public, its elected representatives and their legal and regulatory regimes can get up to speed with these fast-moving developments we need to exercise caution and oversight in AI’s development.”\\n\\nThe remainder of this report is divided into three sections that draw from hundreds of additional respondents’ hopeful and critical observations: 1) concerns about human-AI evolution, 2) suggested solutions to address AI’s impact, and 3) expectations of what life will be like in 2030, including respondents’ positive outlooks on the quality of life and the future of work, health care and education.', 'Some responses are lightly edited for style.']\n"
